## ⚡ **How It Works**

### 🔐 **User Registration & Login**
- Users can create an account by registering with their **email** and **password**.
- After registration, users can log in securely using **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for authentication, ensuring a safe session and user-specific data.

### 📝 **Post on Your Wall**
