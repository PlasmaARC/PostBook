# Full-Stack WebApp: Post Anything

This is my first full-stack web application, where users can create an account and share their thoughts, feelings, or anything they like on their personal wall. The app is built using a combination of **HTML**, **CSS**, **EJS**, and **Node.js** with **Express.js**.

## Features

- **User Authentication:**  
  Users can register and log in to their accounts with a secure authentication system.

- **Post Anything:**  
  After logging in, users can post their thoughts, feelings, or anything they like on their personal wall.

- **Frontend:**  
  Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **EJS**. The interface is responsive and dynamic, providing a smooth user experience.

- **Backend:**  
  The backend is powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js**, handling user data, posts, and authentication.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**  
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templating)

- **Backend:**  
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (for storing user data and posts)
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed when you want to learn from this simple project:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

This project showcases my foundational skills in full-stack development and integrates both client-side and server-side technologies to create a functional, user-friendly web application.
